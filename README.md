## Rules
  
```ruby
- writing tests and verifying the output expected
- executing them without function to test and the code well fail (RED)
- writing fonction to be tested
- executing tests and make sure that it success (GREEN)
- then REFACTORING the code to make it cleaner and more efficient (BLUE)
```
  
## Development Objectives   
  
- [ ] Play with [ramapi](https://github.com/curiousrohan/ramapi)
- [ ] Play with [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
- [ ] Display web interface returning characters' info (format: link)
- [ ] Do the same thing but include search bar and output json object
- [ ] Format all json to make a good UI 
- [ ] Include auto completion for user research
- [ ] Add features to check episodes & all character's locations into
- [ ] Search some "plus value" for our project than reach API with curl
  
## Infrastructure Objectives  
  
- [ ] Automate app deployment with Ansible (Check git submodules)
- [ ] Deploy app using HTTPS and let's encrypt SSL cert
- [ ] Deploy app accessible everywhere and avoid installation of projet (Cloud)
